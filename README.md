## A Space for Classified Ads

   This is web app built using Java Spring and React.js with the purpose to provide a platform
    to post categorized advertisements using a dynamic single page application framework.

   * Java Spring is used to create a RESTful API server that will handle asynchronous requests 
        from the client side application.
   * MySQL is used as the database to store inforation pertaining to the ads posted through the platform.
   * React.js is utilized to create the dynamic, single-page, client-side application that will send data
        to the server utilizing Axios.
   * "User Accounts" take the form of automated HTML emails that provide the necessary links for
         update and delete functionality for individual postings. This will reduce the amount of sensitive information
            stored on the server.
